This visit is about a Royal Society and NSFC joint workshop (from July 24th, 2018 to July 26th, 2018) regarding _requirements modelling for cyber-physical systems_. These guys (Prof. Zhiming Liu, Dr. Bo Liu, Dr Hengjun Zhao, Dr. Liyun Dai, Dr. Xia Zeng, and Mr. Guisen Wu) are really really nice and very glad to meet them in York.
