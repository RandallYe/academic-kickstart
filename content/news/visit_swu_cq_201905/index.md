Very glad to meet Prof. Zhiming Liu's team again and his wife, particularly in Chingqing, the city where I had my BSc and MSc. This is a three-day workshop (['NSFC-RS' Joint Project Workshop on Modelling, Verification, and Refinement of Evolving Cyber-Physical Systems](http://computer.swu.edu.cn/s/computer/kxyj2xsky/20190509/3706486.html)) and I gave a Isabelle/UTP tutorial in Chinese :). Jim presented "Calculational Verification of Reactive Programs with Reactive Relations and Kleene Algebra" and "Probabilistic semantics in RoboChart". Also met nice guys: Xin Chen from Nanjing University and Wang Lin from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University.
