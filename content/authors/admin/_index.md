I am a research associate in the [Circus group](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/circus/), which is a part of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/) at University of York. The group name Circus stands for Concurrent Integrated Refinement CalculUS, a formal language for specification and refinement. 

I have a particular interest in applying mathematics and logic in software engineering. To be more specific, it is application of formal specification and verification in safety critical systems, cyber physical systems (CPS) and robotics. My interests lie in several aspects:

- formal specification using Z, [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) or Circus;
- denotational and operational semantics using Unifying Theories of Programming ([UTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unifying_Theories_of_Programming));
- formal verification using model checking and theorem proving ([Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de));
- tool development to assist application of formal methods.
