After about four months of hard work and one month of review with my supervisor [Prof. Jim Woodcock](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~jim/) (very efficient, many thanks to Jim), finally I submitted my PhD thesis on August 2nd, 2016. My thesis is available [here](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/15526/).
