The talk about "Evolving Robot Software and Hardware" that is presented by [Prof. Gusz Eiben](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/) in [RoboSoft](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/robostar/robosoft/) is very very interesting. It is worth reading the paper ["Evolutionary robotics: what, why, and where to"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2015.00004/full). The project (Autonomous Robot Evolution: Cradle to Grave) ([ARE](https://www.york.ac.uk/robot-lab/are/)) in York is linked with this talk.
