There are two examiners: external examiner ([Prof. Michael Butler](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwipzIrAv9PaAhUGKewKHemUCCUQFjABegQIABAv&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecs.soton.ac.uk%2Fpeople%2Fmjb&usg=AOvVaw0pQDd54Su4YpAdMQ7stv7i)) and internal examiner ([Dr. Jeremy Jacob](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/jeremy)). Jeremy used to be my PhD assessor as well. (The Department of Computer Science at University of York has very [clear and good structure](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/postgraduate/research-degrees/phd/) for the PhD degree and usually every six months you will have a milestone. Then your supervisor and assessor will assess your progress at this point. I found this is extremely helpful, particularly with my supervisor and assessor Jeremy.)

Prof. Michael Butler is a very nice person. I was applying the PhD degree with him at University of Southampton in 2012 and had an interview with him, and finally he gave me an offer. (At that time, York and Southampton are two of my favorite universities. Eventually, I chose to have PhD with Prof. Jim Woodcock at York). I look forward to having a nice talk with Michael and hopefully he is happy with my defense of the thesis. 

Finger crossed! :first_quarter_moon:
