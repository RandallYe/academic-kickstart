The talk about "Testing Robotic Systems: A New Battlefield!" that is presented by [Arnaud Gotlieb](https://www.simula.no/people/arnaud/) in [RoboSoft](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/robostar/robosoft/) is very interesting. Interesting ideas:

- Use constraint programming (CP) to reduce test suite,
- Use constraint-based scheduling for test execution scheduling,
- SICStus 4 for CP.
