This module covers the use of a process algebra for modelling, validation, design, and verification of concurrent reactive systems; in particular, it focusses on CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) and Circus, which combines Z and CSP to model data-rich reactive programs. The module details are available [online](https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/COM00020H/2018-19) at University of York. I am a TA to help Prof. Jim Woodcok in the practical course during the 2018-2019 Spring term. As a TA, I got positive feedback from students regarding my contribution in the practical courses.
