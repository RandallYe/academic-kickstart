summary: "A tutorial on how to use RoboChart and RoboTool to model and verify probabilistic systems."

abstract: "In addition to standard state machines and time primitives, RoboChart also supports probabilistic choices, which allows us to model probabilistic systems in RoboChart. This seminar starts with an introduction of probability modelling in RoboChart using a robotic example. Then it will more focus on how to verify these systems in RoboTool by using PRISM, an existing probabilistic model checker. With recently designed probabilistic assertion language in RoboTool, users are able to use RoboTool even without knowledge of PRISM. However, for advanced users or complicated models, this seminar will give you some hints on how to flexibly use RoboTool and PRISM to verify the properties that are not easily verified by just clicking buttons on RoboTool."
