summary: A pint of science talk by me, James Baxter and Richard Redpath from our group.
abstract: "Robots are becoming part of our everyday lives, from making cars and cleaning the house to assisting with surgery and exploring areas too dangerous for humans to enter. But can we trust them to be safe? In this talk we look at ways that Mathematics, Computer Science, and Software Engineering can play a part to ensure that robots behave in the way we expect them to. We discuss groups of robots working together and the problems and solutions related to working with them. We show the power of these techniques live in action. Using frogs. And the audience. What could possibly go wrong?"

In the early stage of the preparation for the talk, I have developed several versions of the frog jumper solver in CSP to demonstrate the solutions for different board settings and rules.
