 abstract = {Reactive programs are ubiquitous in modern applications, and so verification is highly desirable. We present a verification strategy for reactive programs with a large or infinite state space utilising algebraic laws for reactive relations. We define novel operators to characterise interactions and state updates, and an associated equational theory. With this we can calculate a reactive programâ€™s denotational semantics, and thereby facilitate automated proof. Of note is our reasoning support for iterative programs with reactive invariants, which is supported by Kleene algebra. We illustrate our strategy by verifying a reactive buffer. Our laws and strategy are mechanised in Isabelle/UTP, which provides soundness guarantees, and practical verification support.},
