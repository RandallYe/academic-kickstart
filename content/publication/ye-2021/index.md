abstract: 
    RoboChart is a timed domain-specific language for robotics, distinctive in its 
    support for automated verification by model checking and theorem proving. Since 
    uncertainty is an essential part of robotic systems, we present here an extension 
    to RoboChart to model uncertainty using probabilism. The extension enriches RoboChart 
    state machines with probability through a new construct&#58; probabilistic junctions as 
    the source of transitions with a probability value. RoboChart has an accompanying tool, 
    called RoboTool, for modelling and verification of functional and real-time behaviour. 
    We present here also an automatic technique, implemented in RoboTool, to transform a 
    RoboChart model into a PRISM model for verification. We have extended the property 
    language of RoboTool so that probabilistic properties expressed in temporal logic 
    can be written using controlled natural language.
