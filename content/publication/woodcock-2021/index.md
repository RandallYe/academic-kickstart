abstract: 'RoboChart is a UML-like language designed for modelling autonomous and
  mobile robots. It includes timed and probabilistic primitives. In this chapter,
  we discuss first why we need probability by surveying how we use it in designing
  robots. To illustrate our approach, we focus on the verification of probabilistic
  robotic algorithms for pose estimation. We verify a model-fitting algorithm: random
  sample consensus (Ransac). This is a popular algorithm, representative of a class
  of particle-filter algorithms. We analyse the aspects of the algorithm and show
  how to model-check properties and how to get stronger guarantees using a program
  logic. Our contributions are a survey of probabilistic robotic applications and
  an approach to verifying probabilistic algorithms developed using RoboStar technology.'
